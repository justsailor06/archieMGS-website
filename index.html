“Here's to the crazy ones. 
The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. 
The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. 
They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. 
You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. 
About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. 
They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. 
Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.”

Thanks for being with us in this time of uncertainty of the final product.
If archieMGS ever makes it to market, it's gonna be because of people like you.
The tinkerers. The geeks. The people daring enough to press F12 and read what's here.
You guys are awesome. No matter what, we're going to try and make archieMGS great.
